# Specific Concrete Systems
Combining mathematical proofs, temporal logic of actions, and program implementation.

## Overview
This repository aims to document the process of modelling real-world problems through Mathematical Proofs, Temporal Logic of Actions, and implementing the generated specifications with various programming languages. The breadth and depth of the material, has not yet been determined.

## Acknowledgements
Inspiration for this project was found in Donald Knuth's 'Concrete Mathematics', Leslie Lamport's 'Specifying Systems', and my personal interests and experiences.

## Technologies
As of 2024-07-27 it is like that this project will leverage the following technologies and their respective dependencies

- LATEX
- TLA+
- C
- Rust
- Python
- Mojo

## Prerequisites
It is recommended that the reader has a decent grasp of mathematics, computer science, and computer programming (more specific prerequisites will come at a later date).
